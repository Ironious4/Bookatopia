# Topic:Project

# Purpose
To complete a group project by designing a Book reader web app using our current knowledge and skills in React.


# Setting up the enviroment
Set up the coding environment through these steps:
 1. Create a github repository for the assignment.
 2. Create a react app for the project which will serve as the local repository.
    Automatically it will come with the core folders,files and dependencies for the projects and remember to create your necessary jsx files specific to the project.
 3. Get started on the assignments.


# Structure
The structure of this directory is as follows:
1. build
2. node_modules
3. public
4. src
5. gitignore
6. package-lock.json
7. package.json
8. README.md


# Procedure
The whole project is a group project whereby each member works on specific project features like book management, book categorization, and reading goals and challenges.
Each group member then submit their work to their branches on github and the changes are merged to make the project complete.



# Working through errors
Work in progress should be evaluated by running it in the browser through the command npm start and the codes should be run through the console in the browser in order to confirm whether the codes are working.If they are not working, the console should display the errors in the codes which should give clues on how to rectify the errors.


# Submitting work done
After finishing the project, the changes are merged and the project is deployed live using a hosting platform like vercel.
 
Before we forget,the work is to be submitted to canvas. Simply paste the URL of the work in the submission section of the code challenge and click on submit assignment.

That's pretty much it! The project has been successfully completed and submitted!
